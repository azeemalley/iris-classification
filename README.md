# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

This beginner-level project uses the classic Iris dataset to build a simple machine learning model that classifies flowers into three species using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## 📌 What’s in this project?
- Load and explore the Iris dataset
- Train a KNN classifier
- Predict flower species
- Evaluate model accuracy

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Accuracy
Achieved over 95% accuracy using default KNN settings.

## 🧠 Goal
Improve understanding of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
